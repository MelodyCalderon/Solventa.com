        <p>The Site and the Service may be temporarily unavailable from time to time for maintenance or other reasons.

Under no circumstances will the Company be responsible for any loss or damage, including any loss or damage to any User Content, financial damages or lost profits, loss of business, or personal injury or death, resulting from anyone's use of the Site or the Service, any User Content or Third Party Content posted on or through the Site or the Service or transmitted to Users, or any interactions between Users of the Site, whether online or offline.</p>
        <p>Solventa reserves the right to change any and all content contained in the Site and any Services offered through the Site at any time without notice.

        <p>Disclaimer: Many factors affect your credit scores and the interest rates you may receive. Solventa does not provide “credit repair” services or advice or assistance regarding “rebuilding” or “improving” your credit record, credit history, or credit rating. For details, see the FTC’s website on credit.</p>
        <p>Fixed rates from 5.99% APR to 17.53% APR (with AutoPay). Solventa’s rate ranges are current as of March 30, 2020 and are subject to change without notice. Not all rates and amounts available in all states. See Personal Loan eligibility details. Not all applicants qualify for the lowest rate. If approved for a loan, to qualify for the lowest rate, you must have a responsible financial history and meet other conditions. Your actual rate will be within the range of rates listed above and will depend on a variety of factors, including evaluation of your credit worthiness, income, and other factors. See APR examples and terms. The Solventa 0.25% AutoPay interest rate reduction requires you to agree to make monthly principal and interest payments by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or checking account. The benefit will discontinue and be lost for periods in which you do not pay by automatic deduction from a savings or checking account.
            To check the rates and terms you qualify for, Solventa conducts a soft credit pull that will not affect your credit score. However, if you choose a product and continue your application, we will request your full credit report from one or more consumer reporting agencies, which is considered a hard credit pull.
            </p>
            <p>Minimum Credit Score: Not all applicants who meet Solventa’s minimum credit score requirements are approved for a Solventa Personal Loan. In addition to meeting Solventa’s minimum eligibility criteria, applicants must also meet other credit and underwriting requirements to qualify.</p>
